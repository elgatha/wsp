            <p>My name is Elgatha Lee, everyone calls me Apple (ever-since I
            was a baby) I'm an online student with Full Sail University, but
            for 20 years I was an Executive Chef. This month's project is Web
            Standards Project and this is Week 1. I don't quite understand why
            we can just do everything for Friday, but I guess adding Wednesdays
            keeps you on your toes. This is where I will house my inspiration
            for this project. Some other forms of inspiration include: Major
            Crimes on TNT, PaddleBoarding, LongBoarding, Watching Fitness
            Videos while eating potato chips with dip.</p><br>

            <h2>Header</h2><img src="images/header.jpg">

            <p><strong>Target:</strong> This header is for an audience looking 
            for a creative firm to build their online business presence.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Needs:</strong> The header provides an extremely strong
            call-to-action with powerful typography, that flows in line with the
            company's philosophy. However I would add more powerful taglines
            to grab the users attention.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Response:</strong> As mentioned previously, the header has
            a strong call-to-action within it, the header has a sense of fun 
            and creativity to it.</p><a class="myButton" href="images/header.jpg">View Example</a>

        <section>
            <h2>Call to Action</h2><img src="images/CTA.jpg">

            <p><strong>Target:</strong> This call-to-action is extremely clean and
            has a great rollover that incorporates a colour photograph, that gives 
            an additional element of information for the User.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Needs:</strong>The use of the buttons will enable user to move
            forward in the site or to purchase a service. However I would add more of a transparency on
            the image so the text could pop more.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Response:</strong> The call-to-action area surrounding the
            button provides an comprable information and an image that reflects
            the section of the call-to-action.</p><br>

            <h2>Blog</h2><img src="images/blog.jpg">

            <p><strong>Target:</strong> This blog's element style will be created
            in a different style than what is the "norm" the blog will have an 
            element of a clean-news, style.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Needs:</strong>By providing quality information in a clean 
            format, the blog will entice people to click and continue learning about
            elements that is offered to make their online presence meaningful.
            However I would add a rollover pop of colour for each post.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Response:</strong> This blog will provide and excellent
            compilation of imagery and content, that will not only be beautiful
            and clean, but informative and educational for the user.</p><a class=

            <h2>Navigation</h2><img src="images/navigation.jpg">

            <p><strong>Target:</strong> This menu is created to be clean and and
            dynamic and so that it will give the user the ability to freely move
            through the website, without having to scroll back to the top.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Needs:</strong> There is a dropdown menu element and a super-
            dropdown menu that will give the user the ability to utilize more
            navigation elements. However for the rollovers I would add a pop of 
            colour.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Response:</strong> The clean lines of the menu is a good choice 
            of aesthetics, which will be appealing to the user, as it will provide 
            a powerful yet simplistic navigation.</p><a class="myButton"

            <h2>About</h2><img src="images/about.jpg">

            <p><strong>Target:</strong> The user will be able to see the synopsis
            of the company, brand and features all in one space. Many people have
            the attention of a nat and this design will give the company's 
            information in a bulleted format.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Needs:</strong> The large image will work as a brief portfolio
            enticing the user to continue on to the portfolio. There is no
            call-to-action enticing the user to explore other areas of the site. 
            However the large image that will have portfolio items should entice
            the users to explore. However, I would add a CTA button to the portfolio
            in this section.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Response:</strong> The about section will provide a 
            bulleted-concise view of the company.</p><a class=

            <strong>Needs:</strong> The style is clean and to the point, providing
            the user with the ability to see what sets the company apart. However I think the font could be a hair 			bigger.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Response:</strong> The use of line icons adds a sophisticated
            feel to the site.</p><a class="myButton"

            easily reach out to the business to enquire about services, etc.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Needs:</strong> The contact section provides a clean contact
            form. However the colors and style does not match the site there will
            need to be a creation of a cleaner contact sheet and a change in the 
            font-family.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Response:</strong> The contact section conveys an easy way to

            <p><strong>Target:</strong> Is there to give Visitors and Users a 
            quick and transparent way of finding the creative office.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Needs:</strong> The footer provides quick
            means to obtain view the address and location, etc. along with
            social media. However the colours are not inline with the style
            and design of the entire site, so that would be something that
            would definitely need to change.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Response:</strong> The style however allows the client to 
            easily read the content.</p><a class="myButton" href=

            visitors and users to sign-up for Future Updates, Offers and Incentives.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Needs:</strong> The sign-up provides
           a clear method of communication, I don't see a way to add Full Name or 
           any other pertinent information so that there could be a better track 
           of subscribers.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Response:</strong>The clean style of the newsletter, allows
            for the visitor to sign-up and keep up-to-date.</p><a class=
